            <p id="p1">The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red
                junglefowl (Gallus gallus). They are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total
                population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in
                the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food
                (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting or
                for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period
                (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).
                Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,
                but with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian
                subcontinent. From ancient India, the domesticated chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to
                Greece by the 5th century BC.[6] Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the
                "bird that gives birth every day" having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia,
                according to the annals of Thutmose III.
